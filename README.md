# Data_and_Molecular_Fingerprint_Driven_Machine_Learning_Approaches_to_Halogen_Bonds

The following depository contains the code, figures, and data for the article 
produced by Daniel P. Devore and Kevin L. Shuford, "" {Enter Journal Name Here} 
DOI: {Enter DOI Here}.

The python code for the machine learning approach for predicting the V$_{S,Max}$, 
binding energy (E$_{bind}$), and the X$\cdots$N local force constant (k$^{a}_{X\cdots N}$) 
by the molecular fingerprints and previously obtained data is provided in the jupyter notebook.

The Data folder contains the Data implemented into the machine learning algorithms. The Feature_columns 
directory contains the names of the Features that was used to predict the three above mentioned properties 
in the data driven approach. The CV_results directory contains the coefficient of determination (R$^2$), mean 
absolute error (MAE), and root mean squared error (RMSE) data for all $5$-fold cross validation. The Figures 
folder contains all the figures made throughout the provided script.
